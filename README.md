# tensorwich

Tensorwich is a Python package designed for efficient tensor operations. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for performing mathematical operations on tensors, making it easier for developers and researchers to work with multi-dimensional data.

## Features

- Perform basic tensor operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- Easy-to-use API for tensor manipulation.
- Well-documented and tested.

## Installation

You can install Tensorwich using pip:

```
pip install tensorwich
```

## Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use Tensorwich:

```python
from tensorwich import TensorWich

# Create two tensors
tensor1 = TensorWich([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
tensor2 = TensorWich([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Perform operations
result_add = tensor1.add(tensor2)
result_subtract = tensor1.subtract(tensor2)
result_multiply = tensor1.multiply(tensor2)
```
